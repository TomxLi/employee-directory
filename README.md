<h1>User Story</h1>

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

<h1>Business Context</h1>

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name or sort by name order.
